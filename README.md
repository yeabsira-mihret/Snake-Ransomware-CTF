# Snake Ransomware CTF Simulation üêçüíª

**Category:** Reverse Engineering / Malware Analysis   
---

## Overview

This is a **safe, educational simulation** inspired by a ransomware-style challenge.  
The program mimics a ransomware executable that:

- Appears as a classic Snake game.  
- Contains a hidden XOR-encrypted flag in memory.  
- Unlocks the flag when the player reaches **15 points** in the game.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This project is completely safe. It does **not** encrypt or modify any files on your system. It is intended for learning **reverse engineering** and **malware analysis concepts** in a controlled environment.

## Features

- Terminal-based Snake game (ASCII graphics).  
- XOR-encrypted flag hidden in the binary.  
- `decrypt_key()` function simulates key derivation, similar to malware logic.  
- Flag reveals only after reaching a gameplay milestone (score ‚â• 15).

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler (`gcc`)  
- POSIX-compatible terminal (Linux/macOS)

### Compile

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeabsira-mihret/Snake-Ransomware-CTF
cd Snake-Ransomware-CTF
gcc -O2 -o snake_ctf rasomeware.c -Wall
```
Run
```bash
./snake_ctf
```
## Controls:

W / ‚Üë: Move up
S / ‚Üì: Move down
A / ‚Üê: Move left
D / ‚Üí: Move right

Score at least 15 points to reveal the hidden flag.

## Educational Objectives

Reverse engineer binaries and understand how malware stores secrets.
Learn XOR encryption/decryption in memory.
Practice runtime key derivation and payload unlocking.
Develop basic terminal game programming skills in C.

---

## Flag

Once you reach the target score, the program reveals:
```bash
cxc{malware_is_fun!}
```
